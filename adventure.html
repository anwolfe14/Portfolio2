			<h1>South America</h1>
	<p>In 2018, I was lucky enough to travel to the Galapagos, Peru, and Ecuador for about three weeks with three of friends. During my trip,
	 I was able to see animals that I had never seen before, go to Machu Pichu, and experience the culture of three different countries
	 for a long-period of time. This trip was important for my development because I learned how to step out of my comfort zone in a different environment than I am used to.

		<h2>America</h2>
	<p>In 2017, I traveled across the United States of America. During my trip, I was able to travel the west coast of America.
	 This trip played a large part in my development growing up because I was able to see the different cultures and lifestyles of Americans in different places.
