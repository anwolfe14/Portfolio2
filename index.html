	<h2>Interests</h2>
	<p>Ever since I have been a child, sports have always been a large part of my life. Whether it be through attending sporting events or talking about it with
		my friends and family, I found myself happiest when being involved in sports. As I've grown up, I have also developed an interest in data analytics and data analysis.
		I am looking forward to using these two passions of mine in the future. </p>
