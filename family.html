			<h1>Work Experiences</h1>
	<p> Thus far in my career, I have had the opportunity to experience the work in many different fields.

	<h1>Barcode Experiences</h1>
		<p> In 2017, I created  Barcode Experiences, a 501(c)(3) organization, providing low-income families with exclusive access to sporting events. We coordinated over 15 families to attend Phillies, Flyers, Union, Eagles, and Sixers games. 
			These experiences were important to me because they taught the importance of giving back to my community and the joy that comes with it.

	<h2>Michigan Basketball</h2>
			<p> I am a manager for the Men's Basketball Team at the University of Michigan. I work directly under Coach Juwan Howard, presenting scouting reports to the players and coaches,
			conducting data analysis for the team resulting in game and practice adjustments, and ensuring all Michigan practices and games are filmed and fully set up with the proper equipment.
			This job has been one of the most important and fun parts of my college career not only because of the work that I have been able to do,
			but the relationships that I will have for the rest of my life.

	<h4>Photomyne</h4>
		<p> For the past two summers, I have worked virtually for Photomyne, located in Tel Aviv, Israel. My work has consisted of 
			identifying ways to improve Photomyne marketing, leading to advertisements on SnapChat and TikTok, changes to their website headers, and data analysis. 
			This internship has been important to me because it has shown me the responsibility and communication it takes to work with people from all over the world.
